So far my project has progressed smoothly, I have begun the modeling process and have tried running simulations of the NBA season. For the next week and a half I will attempt to refine the prediction model and write blogs about the process and any insights I notice along the way. I woud like to experiment with different modelling methods to see if I can increase the accuracy, and figure out a way to print the simulation out in a more appealing way / create the projected standings for the season.
